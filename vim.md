# rajayonin's Vim cheatsheet
My personal cheatsheet for Vim/Neovim, with the actions/commands I tend to use.  

Vim is quite useful and powerful, specially for shell-only enviroments (servers, ssh, etc.), and I think every computer engineer/technician should learn at least the basics.  

Don't suffer too much!

## Modes
There are 3 modes on Vim, each mode having its own specific rules:
1. **NORMAL mode:** Keypresses represent [actions](#actions).  
It's the default mode, but you can enter it by pressing `Esc`.
2. **INSERT mode:** Keypresses represent regular characters.  
There are many ways of entering it (see [Insertion](#insertion)).
3. **VISUAL mode:** Here you can select characters using [movement actions](#movement). Unlike the other modes, you perform [visual actions](#visual-actions) instead of regular [actions](#actions).  
Enter it by pressing `v`. You can also exit by pressing `v`.
    1. **VISUAL LINE mode:** Selects whole lines.
        Enter it by pressing `V`. You can also exit by pressing `V`.
    2. **VISUAL BLOCK mode:** Allows to select the same columns across multiple lines.
        Enter it by pressing `Ctrl`+`v`. You can also exit by pressing `Ctrl`+`v`.


## Actions
Actions are the main part of Vim, and allow you to do all sorts of stuff to the text.  
The following actions can only be done in NORMAL mode.  
To cancel any action, press `Esc`.

### Movement

- `h` / `j` / `k` / `l` - **move**  
Move cursor _left_ / _down_ / _up_ / _right_.
- `w` - **word**  
Move cursor to the beginning of the next word.
- `e` - **end**  
Move cursor to the end of the word
- `b` - **beginning**  
Move cursor to the beginning of the previous word.
- `0` - **start of line**  
Move cursor to the beginning of the line.
- `$` - **end of line**  
Move cursor to the end of the line.
- `%` - **parenthesis**  
Move cursor to matching parenthesis.
- `}` / `{` - **block**  
Jump to _next_ / _previous_ block/paragraph
- `gg` / `G` - **goto**    
Move cursor to the _beginning_ / _end_ of the file.
    - `[n]gg` - **goto line**  
    Move cursor to the beginning of line _`n`_.

#### Modifiers
When executing a movement within an [edition](#edition), you can also specify some modifiers, typically used for editing within character pairs (`{}`, `[]`, ...).
- `i[char]` - **inside**  
Perform the action _inside_ the specified pair.
- `a[char]` - **arround**  
Perform the edition inside the specified pair, including the pair.
- `s[char]` - **surrounding**
- Perform the edition on the character pairs.

An example is `di{`, which deletes everything enclosed in the current `{` pair. `{whatever}` â†’ `{}`.


### Insertion

- `i` / `I` - **insert**  
Enter INSERT mode _at cursor_ / at beginning of line
- `a` / `A` - **append**  
Enter INSERT mode _after_ the cursor / _at the end of the line_.   
Useful in combination with end, e.g. `ea` inserts to the end of the word.
- `o` / `O` - **newline**  
Add a new line _after_ / _before_ the current one, enter INSERT mode on new line.
- `s`, `S` - **supress**  
Delete character under the cursor/current line, enter INSERT mode.  
In VISUAL mode, `s` deletes the selection, and `S` is used for the [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) / [nvim-surround](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround) plugin.

### Action modifiers
- `[n][action]` - **repeat**  
Repeats _`action`_ _`n`_ times.


## Visual actions
VISUAL mode allows to select chunks of text using [movement actions](#movement), and perform certain actions on them, similar to selecting text with a mouse, making it a very useful tool.  
The actions are similar to the regular ones, but without specifying a movement.

- `c` - **change**  
  Removes selection and enters INSERT mode.
- `y` - **yank**  
  Copies the selection.
- `d` - **delete**  
  Deletes the selection.
- `>` / `<` - **indent / de-indent**  
_Indent_ / _de-indent_ selection one shiftwidth.
    - `[n]>`, `[n]<` - **indent / de-indent n**  
      _Indent_ / _de-indent_ selection _`n`_ shiftwidths.
- `=` - **autoindent**  
  Automatically indents selection.
- `I` - **insert**  
  Enters INSERT mode. In VISUAL BLOCK mode, all text inserted is applied to all previously selected lines.
- `J` - **join**  
  Joins lines in the selection.
- `u` / `U` - **upper / lower case**  
    Change the selection to _upper_ / _lower_ case.
- `p` / `P` - **replace**
    Replaces the current selection with the clipboard and save / don't save the selection to the clipboard.
- `~` - **toggle case**  
Converts the selection characters' case to lower / upper case, depending on the characters' case.


## Other actions
- `Ctrl`+`y` / `Ctrl`+`e` - **scroll**  
Move screen _up_ / _down_ one line (without moving cursor).
- `Ctrl`+`o` / `Ctrl`+`i` - **go backwards / forwards**  
Moves through the movement history to the _previous_ / _next_ place the cursor was.
- `Ctrl`+`u` / `Ctrl`+`d` - **go up / down**  
Move cursor _up_ / _down_ half a screen size.
- `gv` - **re-select**  
Re-selects the last selection from VISUAL mode.
- `gi` - **goto-insertion**  
Goes to the last insertion location and enters INSERT mode.
- `gq` - **wrap**  
Wraps the specified text (selection/movement) to `textwidth`
- `ZQ` - **force quit**  
Quits Vim, discarding all unsaved changes.
- `ZZ` - **save & quit**  
Save current file and quit Vim.
- `Ctrl`+`a` / `Ctrl`+`x` - **increment / decrement**  
_Increments_ / _decrements_ the number below the cursor.


## Commands
Commands **can only be executed in NORMAL or VISUAL mode**, and are preceded by `:` In VISUAL mode, the command applies only to the selection.  

To execute a command, press `Enter`. To cancel any command, press `Esc`.

Commands can be "forced" by adding `!` at the end. E.g.: `:q!` (force quit).

- `:w` - **write**  
Save current file.
    - `:w [filename]` - **write as**  
    Save current file as _filename_.
- `:q` - **quit**  
Quit Vim.
- `:x` / `wq` - **save & quit**  
Save current file and quit Vim.
- `:e [filename]` - **edit**  
Opens the specified _filename_.
- `:![sh command]` - **shell comand**  
Executes the specified _`sh command`_ shell command.
    - `:.![sh command]` - **capture shell command**  
    Executes the specified _`sh command`_ shell command and redirects the command's STDOUT to the current line in the buffer.  
    There is also a shortcut for this in NORMAL mode, `!!`
- `:s[d][search][d][replace][d]g` - **search and replace**  
Replaces all ocurences of _`search`_ with _`replace`_ within the current line (or selection if VISUAL mode), using the character _`d`_ as a delimeter. This follows [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html)'s syntax.
    - Use `%s` to affect the full file.
    - Add `i` at the end for case insensitive.
    - The delimiter is any character to separate the different parts, preferably that is not in _`search`_ or _`replace`_ so that you don't need to escape it. Traditionally, it's `/`. 
- `:term` - **terminal**  
Opens a terminal view. To exit, use `Ctrl`+`w`+`N`.



## Macros
Macros are series of inputs that can be recorded and redone, extremely useful for repeatable stuff you have to do in an specific file.

- `q[key]` - **start macro**  
Starts recording a new macro _`key`_.
    - `q` - **stop macro**  
    Stops recording the current macro.
    - `q[KEY]` - **append to macro**  
    If _key_ was a lowercase character, e.g. `w`, doing `qW` starts recording again and appends the recorded actions to the `w` macro.
- `@[key]` - **run macro**  
Executes _`key`_.
    - `@@` - **rerun macro**  
    Reruns the last executed macro.

> [!TIP]
> You can combine this with an [action modifier](#action-modifiers) to execute macros _n_ times, e.g. `5@a`.


> [!TIP]
> You can easily edit a macro as text.
> 1. Open a new scratch (temporal) buffer with `:new`
> 2. Write the contents of the macro (register) in the buffer with `:put [KEY]` (e.g. `:put w`)
> 3. Edit the line
> 4. Re-save it to the register with `"[KEY]yy` (e.g. `"wyy`)


## Splits
You can open multiple files side by side within Vim, by using windows.
- `Ctrl`+`w`+`v` - **vertical split**  
Opens the current file in a new vertical split.
- `Ctrl`+`w`+`s` - **horizontal split**  
Opens the current file in a new horizontal split.
- `Ctrl`+`w`+`h` / `Ctrl`+`w`+`j` / `Ctrl`+`w`+`k` / `Ctrl`+`w`+`l` - **change split**  
Move to the split _left_ / _down_ / _up_ / _right_.
- `Ctrl`+`w`+`o` - **current split**  
Closes all splits except the current one.
- `Ctrl`+`w`+`q` - **close window**  
Closes the current window.
- `Ctrl`+`w`+`=` - **equal splits**  
Makes all split sizes equal.
- `Ctrl`+`w`+`r` / `Ctrl`+`w`+`R` - **rotate split**  
Moves the split _clockwise_ / _counter clockwise_
- `Ctrl`+`w`+`H` / `Ctrl`+`w`+`J` / `Ctrl`+`w`+`K` / `Ctrl`+`w`+`L` - **move split**  
Move the split to the far _left_ / _down_ / _up_ / _right_.


## Tabs
You can also use tabs in Vim:
- `:tabnew` - **new tab**  
Creates a new tab.
    - `:tabnew [file]` - **open file in new tab**  
    Opens the specified _file_ in a new tab.
- `gt` / `:tabn` - **next tab**  
Moves to the next tab.
- `gT` / `:tabp` - **previous tab**  
Moves to the previous tab.


## Clipboard
When yanking or pasting text in Vim, it only works _inside_ of Vim, that is, you can't copy stuff into/from your system's clipboard.  
In order to access your system's clipboard, use `"+` before any yank, delete, or paste.  

Alternatively, you can set your system's clipboard as default by adding `set clipboard=unnamed` to your `.vimrc`[^1] (see [configuration](#configuration)).  

For this to work, remember to install `vim-gtk3` on Linux.

[^1]: For Neovim users using Lua config, use `vim.opt.clipboard = 'unnamedplus'`.


## Configuration
Config files are stored in `~/.vimrc`. You can check [my personal configuration](https://github.com/rajayonin/dotfiles/blob/main/vim/.vimrc).

For more information, check `:help vimrc-intro` and `:help option-list`.
