# rajayonin's cheatsheets

This repository is a collection of all my notes and cheatsheets on the different languages and applications I use.  

The list of current cheatsheets is:
- [Vim](vim.md)
- [Markdown](markdown.md)
- [C#](csharp.md)
- [Docker](docker.md)

Most of this stuff is still WIP, so keep that in mind!
